SMART AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM OPTIMIZATION WITH AI AND MULTI-SENSOR MONITORING

A novel aquaculture management system is presented in this project with the goal of improving sustainability and efficiency in response to the rising demand for seafood. The integration of a 7-in-1 Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) Meter, which combines human data entry and machine learning, is essential to its success. The system measures salinity, pH, temperature, and other parameters to provide a comprehensive approach to assessing water quality. Aquaculturists' qualitative insights are incorporated into manual data entry, which enhances the analytical capabilities of the system.

Machine learning facilitates the production of predictive insights by detecting patterns, deviations, and possible hazards. The system's architecture highlights how it can boost aquaculture's productivity, sustainability, and efficiency while facilitating educated choices about disease prevention, feed optimization, and water quality management.

Beyond the benefits to operations, the system helps sustain the sustainability of the industry by conserving resources, lessening its impact on the environment, and promoting food security in the face of an increasing demand for seafood worldwide. In tackling the difficulties posed by the changing global aquaculture landscape, this integrated management system is a major step forward.
